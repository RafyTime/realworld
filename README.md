> ### FastAPI And svelteKit Integration Template (F.A.K.I.T.) codebase containing real-world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc.) that adhere to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.build/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged full-stack application built with **F.A.K.I.T**, including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

This project only adheres to my own preferred coding styles & very opinionated "best" practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
